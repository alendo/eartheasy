Test Summary Report:

What Went Well
 
The project was very inspiring and ultimately we did a great job of putting a lot of the concepts learned in class and implementing it in a real life project. The project kickoff was positive. Our group quickly collaborated and discussed different websites we were going to do. We weighed the pros and cons, how challenging one vs. the other, and we ultimately made the right decision to focus on an eCommerce site that was manageable given the time constraints. 
 
Using the repository (Github) was very seamless. Our team understood how to use it and adding our own code wasn’t an issue. Also, I think each person in the group leveraged each other's strengths to create a project worthy of being used in a portfolio. 
 
What Would We Change
 
I think we would change by discussing the responsibilities earlier in the project and to clarify what each person was going to do. There were times when it wasn’t fully clear and each member just did work without consulting others. I think clear delineation of responsibilities and expectations would be great moving forward with other projects. 
 
Technically, we would like to add more robust tests and also incorporate Page Objects. While our tests were good, it could be improved by better consolidation and organization using POM. 
 
Testing Outcomes

Overall, the test went well. We had sufficient test coverage of the website and all major functionalities and user flows were covered. Looking over our test plan, not much was changed as we carefully and collaboratively groomed and improved it. Given the time constraints, having to complete manual testing as well as automating some user flows, we believe the testing was good. Of course, more time would be better and we are sure that bugs and issues would be found. 

Lessons Learned
- Collaboration makes programming and testing better by exchanging ideas and perspectives
- New tools learned: Github process, VSCode
